# Quant Journey 🚀
Building a profitable algorithmic trading system from scratch.

### Mission
To create, test, and prove a fully rules-based trading strategy that can consistently generate profits — then scale it into a product.

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Market: NIFTY / BTC / NASDAQ (choose one)
- Timeframe: [your chosen one, e.g., 15m or 1D]
- Strategy Type: [e.g., momentum, mean-reversion, breakout]
- Current Goal: Backtest 10 parameter variations and publish performance metrics.

### Progress Log
| Date | Task | Result / Metric |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 2025-11-08 | Created repo, defined hypothesis | — |
| 2025-11-08 | Ran first 10 backtests | Sharpe 1.1, DD 9% |

### Rules
1. 100% transparent process (no hidden data or hindsight bias).  
2. No emotional trades — all rules codified.  
3. Post weekly updates on progress and results.  

### Long-Term Goal
Turn this verified system into a signal-based SaaS or proprietary trading business.  
Everything starts here.
